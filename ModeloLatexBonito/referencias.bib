abstract = {"McSig" is a multimodal teaching and learning environ-ment for visually-impaired students to learn character shapes, handwriting and signatures collaboratively with their teachers. It combines haptic and audio output to realize the teacher's pen input in parallel non-visual modalities. McSig is intended for teaching visually-impaired children how to handwrite characters (and from that signatures), something that is very difficult without visual feedback. We conducted an evaluation with eight visually-impaired children with a pretest to assess their current skills with a set of character shapes, a training phase using McSig and then a post-test of the same character shapes to see if there were any improvements. The children could all use McSig and we saw significant improvements in the character shapes drawn, particularly by the completely blind children (many of whom could draw almost none of the characters before the test). In particular, the blind participants all expressed enjoyment and excitement about the system and using a computer to learn to handwrite.},

abstract = {Like their sighted peers, many blind students in elementary, middle, and high school are naturally interested in space. This interest can motivate them to learn fundamental scientific, quantitative, and critical thinking skills, and sometimes even lead to careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines. However, these students are often at a disadvantage in science because of the ubiquity of important graphical information that is generally not available in accessible formats, the unfamiliarity of teachers with non-visual teaching methods, lack of access to blind role models, and the low expectations of their teachers and parents. We discuss joint efforts by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) National Center for Blind Youth in Science (NCBYS) to develop and implement strategies to promote opportunities for blind youth in science. These include the development of tactile space science books and curriculum materials, science academies for blind middle school and high school students, and college-level internship and mentoring programs. The partnership with the NFB exemplifies the effectiveness of collaborations between NASA and consumer-directed organizations to improve opportunities for underserved and underrepresented individuals.},

abstract = {Millions of people have low vision, a disability condition caused by uncorrectable or partially correctable disorders of the eye. The primary goal of low vision rehabilitation is increasing access to printed material. This paper describes how adjustable typography, a computer graphic approach to enhancing text accessibility, can play a role in this process, by allowing visually-impaired users to customize fonts to maximize legibility according to their own visual needs. Prototype software and initial testing of the concept is described. The results show that visually-impaired users tend to produce a variety of very distinct fonts, and that the adjustment process results in greatly enhanced legibility. But this initial testing has not yet demonstrated increases in legibility over and above the legibility of highly legible standard fonts such as Times New Roman.},

abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that typefaces can convey meaning over-and-above the actual semantic content of whatever happens to be written. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that people match basic taste words (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) to typefaces varying in their roundness versus angularity. In Experiment 1, the participants matched rounder typefaces with the word “sweet,” while matching more angular typefaces with the taste words “bitter,” “salty,” and “sour.” Experiment 2 demonstrates that rounder typefaces are liked more and are judged easier to read than their more angular counterparts. We conclude that there is a strong relationship between roundness/angularity, ease of processing, and typeface liking, which in turn influences the correspondence between typeface and taste. These results are discussed in terms of the notion of affective crossmodal correspondences.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a multi-font OCR system to be employed for document processing, which performs, at the same time, both the character recognition and the font-style detection of the digits belonging to a subset of the existing fonts. The detection of the font-style of the document words can guide a rough automatic classification of documents, and can also be used to improve the character recognition. The system uses the tangent distance as a classification function in a nearest neighbour approach. We have to discriminate among different digits and, for the same character, we have to discriminate among different font-styles. The nearest neighbour approach is always able to recognize the digit, but the performance in font detection is not optimal. To improve the performance of the system, we have used a discriminant model, the TD-Neuron, which is employed to discriminate between two similar classes. Some experimental results and prospective use in document processing applications are presented},

@article{Yang2006,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to recognize Chinese fonts based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD). By analyzing and comparing a great number of Chinese characters, five basic strokes have been selected to characterize the stroke features of Chinese fonts. Based on them, stroke feature sequences of a given text block are calculated. By decomposing them with EMD, some intrinsic mode functions are produced and then the first two, which are of the highest frequencies, are used to produce the so-called stroke high frequency energies, which is the average energy of the two intrinsic mode functions over the length of the sequence. By calculating the stroke high frequency energies for all the five basic strokes and combining them with the averages of the five residues, which are called stroke low frequency energies, a 10-dimensional feature vector is formed. Finally, the minimum distance classifier is used to recognize the fonts and encouraging experimental results have been obtained. The main advantages of our algorithm are that (1) the feature dimension is very low; (2) less samples are needed to train the classifier; (3) finally and most importantly, it is the first attempt to apply the new theory of Hilbert-Huang transform to document analysis and recognition. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Slimane2013,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new font and size identification method for ultra-low resolution Arabic word images using a stochastic approach. The literature has proved the difficulty for Arabic text recognition systems to treat multi-font and multi-size word images. This is due to the variability induced by some font family, in addition to the inherent difficulties of Arabic writing including cursive representation, overlaps and ligatures. This research work proposes an efficient stochastic approach to tackle the problem of font and size recognition. Our method treats a word image with a fixed-length, overlapping sliding window. Each window is represented with a 102 features whose distribution is captured by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). We present three systems: (1) a font recognition system, (2) a size recognition system and (3) a font and size recognition system. We demonstrate the importance of font identification before recognizing the word images with two multi-font Arabic OCRs (cascading and global). The cascading system is about 23{\%} better than the global multi-font system in terms of word recognition rate on the Arabic Printed Text Image (APTI) database which is freely available to the scientific community. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Zahedi2011,
abstract = {Most optical font recognition (OFR) methods have been designed to recognize the font in non-cursive documents. However, the recognition of cursive font scripts like Farsi/Arabic texts has its own challenges. Thus, most of the currently proposed algorithms fail to exhibit an appropriate recognition rate when facing cursive documents. In this paper, a new method for Farsi/Arabic automatic font recognition is proposed which is based on scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) method. As SIFT features are scale-invariant, the final system is robust against variation of size, scale and rotation. The system does not need a pre-processing stage but in the case of low quality images some noise removal processes can be used. Using a database of 1400 text images, an excellent recognition rate of nearly 100{\%} is obtained. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
